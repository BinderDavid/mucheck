# TODO list

* Add a json option for stdargs
* Add a funtion to filter mutants rather than just a fraction
* Add support for other test frameworks
** smallcheck
** smartcheck
* (Longer term) Read all source files from a root directory, and execute
  the entire test suite on all functions (minimal manual oversight)
